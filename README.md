# forEach-map-filter

In this subunit, we'll take a look at three of the most common array methods: forEach, map, and filter. We'll explore the functionality of these methods and when to use them. We touched on higher order functions when we taught you about JavaScript functions back in the Web Fundamentals unit, in this subunit we'll dive deeper into what they are and how they can be used to write more elegant code. You'll do some practice with each of these methods as we go along because they are essential for working with modern JavaScript frameworks and codebases.
